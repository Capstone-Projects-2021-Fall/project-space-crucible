 # Space Crucible

## Project Overview:
  Space crucible is a two-dimensional, top-down perspective action-puzzle game with support for both one and multiple players. Levels will use a tile-based format though action will be in real time and motion will not be locked to the grid. The objective is to solve puzzles in order to proceed to the next level, eliminating monsters and dodging traps along the way.  Multiplayer is a key feature- levels can be designed that require more than one player to complete (in fact, multiplayer-oriented level design will be prioritized). A level editor will be included so users can create their own scenarios and save them in a simple text-based format. Levels can be compiled into level packs using a simple archive format called a “.WAD”, which also contains and organizes any necessary graphics, sounds, and/or music.

 # Space Crucible

## Project Overview:
The proposed application, Space Crucible, is a two-dimensional, top-down perspective action-puzzle game with support for both single player and multiplayer. Levels will use a tile-based format though the action will be in real-time and motion will not be locked to the grid. The combat will be in real-time and take place on tile-based levels similar to the game “Hammerwatch.” However, Space Crucible will have a science fiction theme rather than fantasy, will not likely include role-playing elements, and will emphasize run-and-gun combat rather than a hack-and-slash style.

The objective is to explore and find the exit in order to proceed to the next level, while eliminating monsters and dodging traps along the way.  Multiplayer is a key feature- levels can be designed that require more than one player to complete (in fact, the multiplayer-oriented level design will be prioritized). A level editor will be included so users can create their own scenarios and save them in a simple text-based format. Levels can be compiled into level packs using a simple archive format called a “.WAD”, which also contains and organizes any necessary graphics, sounds, and/or music.

Players will receive a launcher upon starting the game. The launcher will allow the user to pick a level pack, a specific level from the pack, choose the difficulty, and either launch a single-player session or join a multiplayer session. A player can either create a lobby or join a lobby by entering the lobby code if launching multiplayer mode. Real-time action will use WASD or arrow keys to move the player, while the player can simultaneously aim using the mouse. Certain map tiles or objects can be interacted with to proceed in the level, or trigger traps. An in-game chat will allow players to communicate. A very simple light system will allow tiles far from light “sources” to darken, obscuring important puzzle components or hiding sneak attacks, including bridges that the players can pass over or under. MIDI files will be used as background music.

## HOW TO BUILD AND RUN
We are providing a .zip file which will contain all the files and folders required to run this multiplayer game. In the files, there will be a spacecrucible.jar that the windows OS using players are supposed to open with a JAVA launcher that will open the game. Linux users can run spacecrucible.sh and MAC OS users can open legacylauncher.jar.
